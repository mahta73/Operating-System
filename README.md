Operating system’s concepts are among both the most significant and complicated in all of computer science. In
other words, operating system is the most important software that runs on a computer. It manages the computer's
memory and processes, as well as all of its software and hardware. It also allows you to communicate with the
computer without knowing how to speak the computer's language. It is clearly understood that without an
operating system a computer is in vain.

Operating system manages all of the software and hardware on the computer. Most of the time, there are several
different computer programs running at the same time, and they all need to access your computer's central
processing unit (CPU), memory, and storage. The operating system coordinates all of this to make sure each
program gets what it desires.

Operating system typically do the following:

  Booting: Booting is a process of starting the computer operating system starts the computer to work. ...

  manage the computer's resources, such as the central processing unit, memory, disk drives, and printers.

  establish a user interface.

  execute and provide services for applications software.

  Loading and Execution.

  Data security.

  Disk Management.

  Process Management.

  Device Controlling.

  Printing controlling.

It is also vital to comprehend how these ideas are applied in practice in real operating systems of today.
There has been a massive amount of innovation in both the principles and practice of operating systems over the
past two decades. The core ideas in operating systems protection, concurrency, virtualization, resource
allocation, and reliable storage are widely used throughout computer science. I believe the concepts and
principles of operating system are important for anyone getting a degree in computer science or computer
engineering.

Anyone trying to construct resilient, secure, flexible computer systems needs to have a deep grounding in these
topics and to be able to apply these concepts in a variety of settings. This is especially true in a modern
world where almost everything a user does is distributed, and nearly every computer is multi-core.

The fact that operating system’s concepts are popping up in many different areas should not be neglected; even
web browsers and cloud computing platforms have become mini-operating systems in their own right.

Today, smart-phones are the fastest growing part of the mobile phone business. These new devices require much
more complete operating systems, with sophisticated resource management, multi-tasking, security and failure
isolation. Likewise, automobiles are increasingly software controlled, raising a host of operating system
issues. Researchers recently demonstrated that they could remotely turn off a car’s braking system through a
computer virus introduced into the car’s computers through a hacked car radio.

To draw a conclusion, in order to have an impact on the world of modern technology, you should definitely
become a master of both operating System’s functions and characteristics.

## How to run the program?

Original C++ Standard supported only single thread programming.  
The new C++ Standard (referred to as C++11 or C++0x) was published in 2011.  
In C++11 a new thread library is introduced.  

***Compilers Required:***    
***Linux:*** gcc 4.8.1 (Complete Concurrency support)  
***Windows:*** Visual Studio 2012 and MingW  

***How to compile on Linux:***   
$ g++ -std=c++11 -pthread your_file.cpp -o Your_program  
$ ./Your_program
