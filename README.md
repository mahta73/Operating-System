## Why I chose Operating system?

There has been a huge amount of innovation in both the principles and practice
of operating systems over the past two decades.

I believe the concepts and principles of operating system are important for anyone getting a degree in computer science or computer engineering.

The core ideas in operating systems protection, concurrency, virtualization, resource allocation, and reliable storage are widely used throughout computer science.

Anyone trying to build resilient, secure, flexible computer systems needs to have a deep grounding in these topics and to be able to apply these concepts in a variety of settings.    
This is especially true in a modern world where nearly everything a user does is distributed, and nearly every computer is multi-core.

Operating systems concepts are popping up in many different areas; even web browsers and cloud computing platforms have become mini-operating systems in their own right.

Today, smartphones , phones capable of running independent third party applications , are the fastest growing part of the mobile phone business. These new devices require much more complete operating systems, with sophisticated resource management, multi-tasking, security and failure isolation.

Likewise, automobiles are increasingly software controlled, raising a host of operating system issues.

Can anyone write software for your car?  
What if the software fails while you are driving down the highway?  
How might the operating system of your car be designed to prevent a computer virus from
hijacking control of your car’s computers?  

Although this might seem far fetched, researchers recently demonstrated that they could remotely turn off a car’s braking system through a computer virus introduced into the car’s computers through a hacked car radio.

A goal of this thesis is to explain how to build more reliable and secure computer systems in a variety of contexts.

Precisely because operating systems concepts are among the most difficult in all of computer science, it is also important to understand how these ideas are applied in practice in real operating systems of today.

## How to run the program?

Original C++ Standard supported only single thread programming.  
The new C++ Standard (referred to as C++11 or C++0x) was published in 2011.  
In C++11 a new thread library is introduced.  

***Compilers Required:***    
***Linux:*** gcc 4.8.1 (Complete Concurrency support)  
***Windows:*** Visual Studio 2012 and MingW  

***How to compile on Linux:***   
$ g++ -std=c++11 -pthread your_file.cpp -o Your_program  
$ ./Your_program
