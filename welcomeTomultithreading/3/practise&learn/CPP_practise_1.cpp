  // Pointers in c++

  /*
    Some C++ tasks are performed more easily with pointers, and other C++ tasks,
    such as dynamic memory allocation, cannot be performed without them.

    As you know every variable is a memory location and every memory location has
    its address defined which can be accessed using ampersand (&) operator which
    denotes an address in memory.

    A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable.
    type *variable_name;
    Here, type is the pointer's base type; it must be a valid C++ type and var-name
    is the name of the pointer variable.
